                <p>The picture you see on this page is me, HAHAHAHA.
                    I created the artwork during pandemic time, I'm just bored that time and I saw a artwork on twitter and copied the concept.
                    Yeah it's not my original concept, I'm sorry for that. Btw I use photoshop and drawing tab to create that shitty art hahaa.

                <p><img class="kimBum photos" src="./assets/art1.jpg" alt=""></p>
                <p>This art I made during the release of <em>Attack on Titan</em> season 4 part 1. The anime was very hyped during that and the trailer is so amazing, I was amazed when war hammer titan transformed and
                    I thought maybe I could make a digital artwork with that kind of thunderbolt effect.
                </p>
                <p>So I decided to make a artwork of kim bum and put thunder bolt on his fingers inspired by AoT.
                    I'm just so bored that time and yeah my creative spirit is on fire and I can't stop it.
                </p>
                <p>I spend almost 8 hours sitting infront of my computer with my drawing tab, making it perfect while watching youtube tutorials.
                    Yeah that was 4 years ago, I don't know if I have that photoshop skill til now. But I can relearn it by wathing youtube again.
                    I just need more practice to relearn the skills.
