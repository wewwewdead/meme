                <p>The picture you see on this page is me, HAHAHAHA.
                    I created the artwork during pandemic time, I'm just bored that time and I saw a artwork on twitter and copied the concept.
                    Yeah it's not my original concept, I'm sorry for that. Btw I use photoshop and drawing tab to create that shitty art hahaa.

                <p><img id="kimBum" class="kimBum photos same" src="./assets/art1.jpg" alt=""></p>
                <p>This art I made during the release of <em>Attack on Titan</em> season 4 part 1. The anime was very hyped during that and the trailer is so amazing, I was amazed when war hammer titan transformed and
                    I thought maybe I could make a digital artwork with that kind of thunderbolt effect.
                </p>
                <p>So I decided to make a artwork of kim bum and put thunder bolt on his fingers inspired by AoT.
                    I'm just so bored that time and yeah my creative spirit is on fire and I can't stop it.
                </p>
                <p>I spend almost 8 hours sitting infront of my computer with my drawing tab, making it perfect while watching youtube tutorials.
                    Yeah that was 4 years ago, I don't know if I have that photoshop skill til now. But I can relearn it by wathing youtube again.
                    I just need more practice to relearn the skills.

                <h1 class="content-heading">This is <em>Park Seo Joon</em>, as captain Levi.</h1>
                <p><img src="./assets/art2.jpg" id="seoJoon" class="seoJoon photos same" alt=""></p>
                <p>This was my first digital painting, I got inspired by the greatness of <a href="https://www.artstation.com/wlop" target="_blank">WLOP</a> he is a chinese artist.
                I watched his youtube painting timelapse and I thought I can make my own digital painting using his tyle of painting.
            It was very hard because I don't know how to mix a color to make a new color, for example for the skintone. As you can see it was very warm on the darkside of the face of Seo Joon.
        The most challenging thing is making it more realistic, making a shadow while maintaining a realistic look.
    </p>
    <p>The proportion of the painting is also hard, my reference is not well proportion to the dress I put, so I change the body proportion to make it more fancy looking and not look awkward.
         </p>
         <p>Now the hair part, it was very easy compared to traditional art, in photoshop you can just make a hair in a minute while not scrubbing to much on the canvas using your paint brush, instead just use a fill tool in photoshop and make outline and fill the outline
            with the color you choose, just make sure the outline has no leak or it will fill the whole canvas.
         </p>
         <p>At that time I thought that making a digital painting is easy, but it's not. You need to master photoshop tools and it's functionality, or else you're gonna be fuckd up.</p>
